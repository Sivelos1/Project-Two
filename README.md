# MyFolio 

  ## Description

  MyFolio is a place to show off your development portfolios to potential employers and peers. Users can comment on projects uploaded, users can have multiple projects to their name. Having places beyond GitHub and individual websites to present our portfolios allows users to have access to a more diverse and interactive audience. This can improve their code, impress employers, and create connection amongst the development community
