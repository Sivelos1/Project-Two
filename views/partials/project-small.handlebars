{{!--  This partial will be for displaying projects in a small and concise manner, such as on the user project 
management page, the dashboard, etc. Ideally it should display the project's title, and thumbnail.

Ideas: 
    - Display some kind of summary / excerpt?
    - Hovering over this could maybe display some media, like a slideshow? If possible, since not every project may have images
    - Click on this to go to a project's page? --}}
