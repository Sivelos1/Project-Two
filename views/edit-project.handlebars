{{!--  This will be for creating / editing a project. You should be able to enter a title, use a markdown editor to edit the 
project's body, upload media (with a separate(?) upload for the project's thumbnail), and maybe control misc. settings, like
comment display.

    Ideas:
        - Should the project's thumbnail be a separate upload, or should it automatically scan its media for an image? 
        Maybe both, if the user doesn't upload a thumbnail?
        - A setting for displaying comments? Maybe one for disabling comments, too. I dunno, we can brainstorm once we get the 
        main stuff working  --}}
